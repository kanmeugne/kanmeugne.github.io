## Context

Few months ago, I found an [article][3] that explains how to build [GoogleTest and GoogleMock][4] directly in a [CMake][5] project. Since the approach is amazingly straightforward, I have managed to test it with [SFML][6] on a simple graphical app.

## Presentation of the Approach

In his article, [Craig Scott][3] explained how to build *GoogleTest* and *GoogleMock* directly in a *CMake project*. The configuration can be used almost as-is to add *SFML* dependencies as an *external project*.

The main idea is to invoke *CMake* `ExternalProject` *command* and perform the build at *configure time*. This fully integrates the *external project* to your build and gives you access to all the *targets*. The author uses two sets of rules to configure the *build*.
