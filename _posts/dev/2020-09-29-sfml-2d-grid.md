## Context

This is a simple task I had to do quite a lot of time since I started modeling and simulation of pedestrian movement. A 2D Grid is the simplest you can get if you are looking for manageable navigable space, where to process both path calculation and collision avoidance. In this post, I am going to share some C++ code that you can use to build a simple and customizable 2D Grid.

## Presentation of the Approach

In his article, [Craig Scott][3] explained how to build *GoogleTest* and *GoogleMock* directly in a *CMake project*. The configuration can be used almost as-is to add *SFML* dependencies as an *external project*.

The main idea is to invoke *CMake* `ExternalProject` *command* and perform the build at *configure time*. This fully integrates the *external project* to your build and gives you access to all the *targets*. The author uses two sets of rules to configure the *build*.
