I have been teaching python to different kind of beginners students from college to university and this simple issue pops surprisingly often : what do you need to install to be up and ready quickly ? This post will be of little interest for experienced users -- but for those who want concise instructions to start with python, you are in the right place !


I will assume that you are working on an Ubuntu machine. The reason I am confident with this assumption is that ubuntu is a very popular Os for developers (beginner and experienced ones) and Microsoft (which is the most popular Os among normal human being) provides a descent linux subsystem -- read this article to understand how to set it up -- that runs an Ubuntu by default. So I am pretty sure that the reader (this is you) will be able to set up an Ubuntu machine with little effort.
