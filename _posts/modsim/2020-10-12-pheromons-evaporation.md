title:  "Modeling pheromon evaporation on a 2D Grid with SFML"
teaser: "In a previous article, I presented a C++ SFML application that models a 2D Grid with the possibility to add and remove obstacles. In this post, I am going to add a very nice feature : <i>pheromon evaporation</i>. I will discuss how this kind of feature could profit operational research and online optimization modelers."

## Introduction

You should now be familiar with our [2D Grid app][1] so I won't present it again. In a [previous post][1], I updated the architecture in order to implement the add/remove obstacles feature. Here, I am going to upgrade the architecture again in order to implement pheromon management.

You can see pheromon like a chemical substance that is dropped somewhere, as a mark of a given organic activity, and then evaporates overtime. It is a very productive way to implement a *stigmergic* behavior --- which is a type of behavior based on indirect communication through a common and shared space. Stigmergy explains the emergence of collective behavior among several social species with limited intellectual capacities. The concept has been first introduced by the french biologist [Pierre-Paul Grass√©][2] and systematically studied by [Deneubourg][3] for different ants species.

In this post, I am going to detail the architecture that allows me to mimic an ant-like pheromon evaporation. The objects are the same, comparing to the [previous architecture][1]. Simply put, I am going to do the following : 

1. add another viewer for pheromon --- *PheromonViewer* --- and more controls in the *App* object -- *App::addPheromon*
2. upgrade *IGrid*, and consequently *Grid*,  to declare and implement pheromon related methods
3. define a new method --- *App::evaporate* --- responsible of the evaporation process.
