Pedestrian simulation is an exciting multidisciplinary exercice. Among other skills, it requires good knowledge on path planning, path following and collision avoidance algorithms. This article starts a serie of 3 tutorials where I am going to share a c++ code that I am actually using for my personal projects on pedestrian simulation. 

This article is the first of a serie of 3 tutorials where I am going to share forkable c++ code to address path planning, path following and collision avoidance respectively within a pedestrian simulation framework.
