title:  "Build your own pedestrian simulation with RVOLib"
teaser: "Pedestrian simulation is an exciting and multidisciplinary exercice. Developing a simulator implies a good knowledge about navigation behavior, performant algorithms for path planning and collision avoidance among other skills. this post present a C++ app that can help you start with this very demanding task. I will be using RVO Lib which is a C++/CSharp lib for real-time collision avoidance."
