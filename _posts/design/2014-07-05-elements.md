## Images

There are different ways to use images. The most present images can be positioned in the header or on top of the headline.

If you don't want any header image just write `image_header: "no"
` into front matter.



## Subheadlines

If you need a subheadline for an article, just define it in front matter like this:

`subtitle:  "Subheadline"`


## Quotes

Quotes mix it up a little bit, if you write long articles. So use quotes:

> Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.
